# Local Installation
## Prerequisites
To run AOAME locally you first need to install the following software:

- Git: <https://git-scm.com/downloads>

- JDK: <https://adoptium.net/temurin/archive/?version=17> Make sure you install the current version of the project: **Temurin 17.0.7+7**

- Either IntelliJ: <https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/> (requires academic license)
or Eclipse: <https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/> or only Maven: <https://maven.apache.org/>

- Optionally WebStorm: <https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/> (requires academic license)

- Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v16.4.2  
Important: Install the node version that is required by the WebApp project in package.json. Check it via the link: [WebApp repo package.json](https://github.com/BPaaSModelling/OntologyBasedModellingEnvironment-WebApp/blob/master/package.json)  
- Check the required node version here: `"engines": { "node": "'Node_Version'" }`

To make changes to the source code of the WebService it is recommended to install IntelliJ or Eclipse which comes with its own version of Maven. If you do not plan on making changes to the WebService it is also possible to install Maven on its own.

When installing Eclipse make sure to choose ‚ÄúEclipse IDE for Enterprise Java and Web Developers‚Äù.

WebStorm is not needed for running AOAME locally but it can be used to make changes on the WebApp.

## Setup Development Environment
To contribute to the project, set up the development environment:
- Run `setup_local.bat` (Windows) or `setup_local.sh` (MacOs/Linux) file
- This script will git pull all required repositories: WebApp, WebService, JenaFuseki into **aoame/** directory

After the script has finished, you will need to build the WebService and the WebApp before they can be used.

## Building the WebService

### Using IntelliJ (recommended)

Start IntelliJ, open the WebService project: click *File*, *Open*, provide the path to WebService. The WebService is inside of newly created *aoame* folder *OntologyBasedModellingEnvironment-WebService.*

To build the project, click *Run* and *Edit Configurations*. Then, add the following configuration in IntelliJ and run it.

![b9272fc3f8e3dc466663c5f51b40a981](https://github.com/BPaaSModelling/AOAME/assets/18686110/465f8ac6-a6ef-48d2-b36f-148b14e2f752)

### Using Eclipse

Start Eclipse and click *File* then *Import‚Ä¶*

![ab35623fca096f8ed0f4e7e706deca72](https://github.com/BPaaSModelling/AOAME/assets/18686110/16a654eb-05d7-4901-835e-2970e3c361ad)

Select *Projects from Folder or Archive*. Then click on *Next*.

![6d7c73468e82a5148f7df757566b3fc6](https://github.com/BPaaSModelling/AOAME/assets/18686110/e548a828-f1c5-4946-911a-c51be9e3c4ce)

The *setup_local.bat* script should have created a folder called *aoame* which contains a folder called *OntologyBasedModellingEnvironment-WebService.* Select the *OntologyBasedModellingEnvironment-WebService* folder by clicking *Directory‚Ä¶* and navigating to it.

After you have selected the directory click *Finish*.

![78d72e6861cd432b2df37716aedbace0](https://github.com/BPaaSModelling/AOAME/assets/18686110/e5074011-6d4d-4fae-af8b-02604c78f372)

You can also add a second configuration with *heroku-start*. This can be used to start the WebApp through WebStorm.

![1ef3f813a04304340b264a67411c046d](https://github.com/BPaaSModelling/AOAME/assets/18686110/d6df5aa8-0572-4721-ba59-f164dc986432)

### Using the Command line

If you do not want to use WebStorm you can use the command *ng build* to build the WebApp.

## Starting AOAME

To start fuseki, the WebService and the WebApp at the same time you can use the *start_local.bat* script.

To start fuseki on its own run the *fuseki-server.bat* script inside the *fuseki-heroku-test* folder.

To start the WebService on its own run the *start webserver.bat* script inside the *OntologyBasedModellingEnvironment-WebService* folder.

To start the WebApp on its own run *node server.js* in a command prompt inside the *OntologyBasedModellingEnvironment-WebApp* folder.

## Pushing the artifact to GitHub and AOAME

To push your version to GitHub follow the steps below:

1. Ensure you have access to the required repositories for your project. Depending on the scope, it might be 1-3 repos:

<https://github.com/BPaaSModelling/OntologyBasedModellingEnvironment-WebApp>

<https://github.com/BPaaSModelling/OntologyBasedModellingEnvironment-WebService>

To push a new ontology you will need access to:  
<https://github.com/BPaaSModelling/Ontology4ModelingEnvironment>

2. Create a personal access token to push it from Intellij/WebStorm/Eclipse, unless you have another authentication method like the ssh key. Usually, the GitHub account password doesn‚Äôt work.

Open GitHub -\> Settings -\> Developer Settings -\>Personal access tokens -\> Tokens (classic) -\> Create one token with default repo access -\> copy the token, you will need it later.

3. Open Intellij/WebStorm/Eclipse. Go to Git -\> Connect to the respective repository -\> Use your token as a password when connecting.

4. Create a new branch for your version, commit all your changes, and push.

![6d9de8b321c5a6833363c129b4a5df26](https://github.com/BPaaSModelling/AOAME/assets/18686110/df6198b2-eafb-4ea9-aa97-2deaeae21535)

5. Now, merge your branch into the master branch.

In Intellij or WebStorm, right-click the master branch and click "checkout the master". Now, you can merge your branch into the master branch (screenshot below). Once it is done, please test that everything works as expected. If testing is successful, push the new master branch.

![60242dbde1711737379b10c948a1f4ca](https://github.com/BPaaSModelling/AOAME/assets/18686110/dc1aa283-441a-4a33-8a37-2dc85895e178)

If you need to push to the Ontology4ModelingEnvironment repo, first you need to merge the master into your own branch.

Create a Pull request directly from GitHub that will be merged when approved (see screenshots).
